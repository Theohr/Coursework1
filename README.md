# Model Loader CW1 (10578755)
  
## Visual Studio Version 
Visual Studio 2019 

## OpenGL Version 
OpenGL 3.3 or later 

## How to work 
Set the project up in Visual Studio and run the Project. It should display the OBJ file in a window. 

## How does code fit together? 
First thing we create our VAO and our Buffers. Implementing a function that reads and parse the Creeper.obj file feeding the data into our variables. Loading the Shader. Pushing the Data into the Arrays. Feeding the Data into the appropriate Buffers. Creating the Texture. Creating the MVP matrix. Messing with the display function to print out the Creeper.
